# Course Description
Computers affect our lives in a nearly uncountable number of ways. They now are critical to finance, travel, education, health care, and practically every other sector of society. But these computers require programming in order to perform their tasks, programs written by people with their own motivations, biases, and styles. These programs, moreover, have a purpose: to create effects in the computer and, by extension, in the people who use these programs.
Poetry likewise may be thought of as a program, one designed to raise emotions, thoughts, and images in the minds of its readers. How, then, does a poem achieve these ends? What is the processor for a poem?
In this course we will explore how language works on the mind and how a computer program works on a computer. What can the similarities and differences between how these two forms of code work tell us about the mind, about computers, and about ourselves?
​
# Learning Goals
* Recognize and be able to analyze the formal characteristics of verse.
* Recognize and be able to name the formal characteristics of computer programs.
* Read and be able to explain the main ideas in a piece of code or poetry.
* Compare and contrast the ways poetry and programs function.
* Identify the audiences and purposes for poetry and computer programs.

# Readings, Materials, and Resources
All course materials will be made available for free on Lacuna, a digital reading, annotating, and writing platform developed at Stanford (by yours truly). The site is available at https://stanford.lacunastories.com. You will also be able to access the course materials through Canvas.
Any students who need alternative accommodations for the course materials should let me know.
​
# Course Policies and Expectations
​## Attendance and Submission Policies
All students are expected to adhere to the Stanford Honor Code. Moreover, students are expected to come to class having done all the assigned reading and prepared to participate in discussion. Because this is a discussion-based class, regular attendance is expected. Absences in more than three (3) class meetings will result in a lowered grade.
​
## Assignments
Students will be expected to annotate each text assigned in advance of the class meeting. These annotations will guide our discussions. Additionally, students will write short response papers (approximately 500 words) each week, to be shared with the rest of the class. Final projects can be either collaborative or individual work and can take the form of an analytical essay, a creative project (e.g., a series of poems), or some other form based on each student’s interest. Students will prepare a project proposal that will guide the work on their final course activity.
​
## Evaluation and Grading Criteria for Student Work and Class Participation
To demonstrate mastery of this course’s learning goals, students should attend class, participate regularly in discussion, make at least 5 class-visible annotations per week, write at least 1 short response each week, and submit a final project.
Overall grades will be calculated based on the entirety of a student’s work for the quarter. The final grade will be based on a weighted average of this work:
* Annotations: 20%
* Class Participation: 20%
* Short Written Responses: 20%
* Final Project: 40%

## Grading Rubric for Written Work
All written work, including annotations, should be thoughtful. The written response work and final project will be evaluated according to the following rubric:
* A: Argues a clear thesis with precision, deploys evidence effectively to support its thesis, is well-organized, free of grammatical and spelling errors, and adheres to proper citation format.
* B: Does not succeed in all the points necessary for an “A”, but is generally successful. Has a thesis, but does not fully connect the body of the paper to that thesis.
* C: May lack a thesis or have only a weak thesis. Or, if a thesis is present, lacks evidences to support it or is so disorganized that the reader cannot easily understand it.
* D: Lacks a thesis, provides only a vague awareness, if any, of the object of discussion. May suffer from overwhelming mechanical problems.
* F: Demonstrates little to no understanding of the assignment. Does not fulfill even the basic requirements.

## Students with Documented Disabilities
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).
